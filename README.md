# Angular Lightning

> Angular bindings and UI Components for Salesforce Lightning Design System

## Current Status

We have working components for many of the Lightning Design Components. The dependencies are not very lightweight and the build process is not very clean yet but that should be around the corner.

For now you can view demo's of the available lightning components here:
